This app was created by myself some years ago and now I decided to use it as portfolio. It was only a prototype, an idea that I wanted to show the board of directors of the company I was working by the time. It isn't commented and I haven't implemented security measures to it, although it was used (and worked almost 100% smooth) 3 times on mock simulations.

The app isn't only local, it has a back-endand it connects to a MySQL database (but I removed the links and passwords). The mock simulations involved other employees role playing parents and students.

The idea of the app is to improve speed and security when parents pick-up kids in school. There used to be a line of cars so my idea was that someone would have a phone with the app on the entrance (parents would not have the app but instead only a QR Code that would identify them). This person on the entrance would scan the QR Code and the app would register the time and name of the parent on the database and also the name of the children would go to a list. Someone inside the school would be responsible for organizing the kids and this person would have another android device and would be checking a list, and the list would indicate who are the next children to be picked up, improving speed and logistics.

The app is working (it is connecting to a database and doing everything it was supposed to like a charm, but as it is insecure, I can't share the links and password of the database nor send the apk for someone to use it) and I will soon make a video showing how it works.

Down below you can see screenshots of the app
